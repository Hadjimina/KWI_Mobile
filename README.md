This is an Android application which lets the students of the KWI in switzerland access their timetable data in real time.
It was my Senior Project so the complete written documentation (45 Pages) can be found here : https://goo.gl/rBFZpq

If some KWI student wants to continue to work on this project, feel free to do so. Never the less I would appreciate a heads up. Enjoy !
